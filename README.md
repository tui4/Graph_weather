# Graph the Weather
A Simple Python program that will graph the average max and min temperature using data pulled from The Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Developed on a Debian system in early 2013.

- Uses Matplotlib, BeatifulSoup and Browser

I have since moved to using lxml instead of BeatifulSoup; and requests instead of Browser.
